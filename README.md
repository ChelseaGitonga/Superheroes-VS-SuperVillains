### Project Summary:
"Proof of Concepts" project, where random superhero names and random supervillain names are generated.
### External node modules used:
- superheroes
- supervillains
### Languages and technologies:
- Node.js 
- Unix Command Line
### Purpose:
This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in using external node modules and working with the command line interface. It uses the “superheroes” and “supervillains” modules to randomly generate superhero and supervillain names respectively. The project serves as a “Proof of Concepts” project, showing my understanding of how to install and utilize external modules in a Node.js application. Additionally, it showcases my understanding of how to interact with the command line interface to run the application and view the generated names.
